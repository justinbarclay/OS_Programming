In this day and age, we use technology more than we tend to realize. It has integrated with different parts of our society and helps improve the quality of our lives. In the past couple of decades, technology has grown at an unprecedented level. Hence, as James Moor said, “we should analyze the nature and social impact of computer technology and the corresponding formulation and justification of policies for ethical use of such technology” [1]. One major breakthrough in recent years in technology is cryptocurrency; it has the capacity of fundamentally changing how we use money in our daily lives. However, with its innovation it has also brought about unforeseeable issues for which we do not have proper structures to control it. This leads to formation of policy vacuum [1]. In this essay, we will discuss: first, what is cryptocurrency; second, how does cryptocurrency work; and finally, we will discuss from an objectivists view [2], the ethical issues such as anonymity, Intellectual property/spread of technology and threats to security that are associated with cryptocurrency.
Cryptocurrency is a digital currency designed to work as a medium of exchange, which uses encryption and cryptographic techniques to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds. It is different from regular currency and online banking as it is a decentralized banking system where the government has no control over it, unlike Canadian dollar, which is completely centralized. Bitcoin was created by the alias Satoshi Nakamoto, in 2009 it became the first decentralized cryptocurrency [3]. Bitcoins are produced by the entire cryptocurrency system collectively, at a rate defined when the system was created which is publicly known. Bitcoin will never have more than 21 million coins. Prior to Bitcoin there were alternatives to online payments; such as DigiCash by David Chaum and PayPal by Peter Thiel and Elon Musk [4].
There are several advantages of cryptocurrency over traditional currency. It is secure (military grade security and minimizes fraud as it cannot be counterfeited), anonymous (names of buyers and sellers are never revealed – only their wallet IDs, hence also prevent identity theft), instantaneous, cheap international payment (not tied to any country), investment/deflationary in nature. In addition, since there are no banks a user has a higher level of control over their money and there is low transactional fees [5 - 6]. There are also some disadvantages to this technology, the wallets in which Bitcoins can be stored can be lost (hard drive crashes, viruses) with no form of recovery, valuations fluctuate, no buyer protection (merchant might not send the product) [7], enables fraud and other criminal activities [8].
Technology has made our lives convenient, tasks such as accessing information or buying products online that was not possible before. The SAS predicts that the economic value of IoT’s (Internet of things) will be greater than 1.9 x 1012 in 2020 [9]. Due to this, many consider IoT’s to be the future of technology; and cryptocurrency is a part of it, making it the future of currency. There are more than 700 digital currencies. Due to the popularity of bitcoin and its prospect of people profiting from it, it will attract more number of users to it, who would look for cheaper alternative. Hence, Due to this along with the advantages of cryptocurrency it could lead to a prospective boom in the use of this technology. Hence, it is important for us to explore the potential of this technology.
 
 HOW BITCOIN WORKS
 Bitcoin is largely based on a peer-to-peer system with the network being made up of its users’ machines.  Users on the Bitcoin network monitor and verify both the creation of new Bitcoins through the mining process as well as the transfer of Bitcoins between senders and receivers. This is done by maintaining a log of all transactions, with every new transaction broadcasted across the network. Miners communicate to create and agree on updates to this official log. This process is computationally expensive and is also the process used to create new Bitcoins.
 Bitcoin uses public key encryption to provide security against theft, but it does not prevent a payer from double spending bitcoins. In a centralized system, this can be safeguarded against by clearing all transactions through a single database. To get around this, the Bitcoin network keeps a list of all transactions approved to date. These transactions come in 2 varieties: where bitcoin currency is created and where bitcoin currency is transferred between 2 entities.
 A hashing algorithm converts a message into random-looking gibberish. This random-looking gibberish, or hash, provides a unique representation of the original in the sense that there should not be another message, that when run through the same hashing algorithm, generates the same hash. We call this property collision-resistance. It is also impossible or computationally infeasible to reconstruct the original message from just the hash. We thus say that the hashing algorithm is a one-way function.
 Broadcasted transactions are divided up into ‘blocks’ and contain the hash for the previous block which was accepted and verified by the network. This last block always comes from the tip of the longest chain of blocks on the network and is in effect, the official log.
 In order to validate a new block and add it to the official log, also known as the blockchain, some computer on the Bitcoin network must create a transaction log for it that integrates with the previous blocks. This transaction log is very computationally expensive to any individual computer on the network but relatively cheap for the network as a whole. Creation of this transaction log involves using the valid blocks and the block consisting of the new transactions to generate a hash consisting of <t_co> bits and is considered done when a hash below a preset target(eg the number 11) is generated. The target is set and reset periodically such that this puzzle is solved by some computer on the network every 10 minutes.
 This thus means that for an attacker to  ‘defraud’ a block, the attacker would be required to outpace the network’s combined computing power. In this way, the system thus relies on individual users to maintain the integrity of the blockchain. Furthermore, there is incentive for the first user that cracks the forced-work puzzle in the form of receiving a certain amount of bitcoins. These newly generated bitcoins are validated when other users on the network agree to append the new block to the official log, the blockchain.
 This system of monetary incentives for maintaining the ledger is also how the Bitcoin system introduces new currency into the world. The minting rate will slowly decrease over the years until the total supply of bitcoins plateaus around the year 2030[10].
 CONCEPTUAL MUDDLE AND CURRENT LEGISLATION
    Bitcoin’s legal status varies significantly between countries which strongly implies the existence of a conceptual muddle. In Argentina, Bitcoin can be considered money, but cannot be considered legal currency.While in Ecuador, the government has banned the use of Bitcoins and other digital currencies[11,12]. In Canada, the system is regulated[13]. This conceptual muddle is further complicated by the numerous different classifications that exist for Bitcoin. 
        In Canada, regulators are still trying to determine whether cryptocurrencies such as should be regulated as commodities or as currencies[14].
        Ethical Issues:
        Threats to Security:
        Cryptocurrency comes with a vast array of advantages compared to regular currency. However, it does present some issues as well. These issues can lead to harm to society and endanger national security.
        Cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin, damage the ability of the government to collect taxes [15]. Transactions that occur are independent from formal banking systems. Since determining taxable income is based upon reporting to a country’s revenue service, it becomes extremely difficult to account for income that is anonymized by the use of cryptocurrencies. Therefore, it is easier for individuals to evade taxes through the use of cryptocurrencies. This can cause society as it reduces the government’s ability to fund the services it provides to its citizens, like infrastructure, schooling, and public health.
        (Taken from the source the entire thing more or less)Central banks also enable countries to withstand financial panics due to the ability to manage a unified national currency. A central bank manages fractional reserve lending that allows a national economy to expand.  The supply are limited for crypto-currency by algorithmic design, so an economy running on Bitcoin cannot expand beyond its algorithmic limit  to accommodate an increased demand for more currency in circulation .  A Bitcoin based economy cannot grow beyond a certain point as it will be unable to deploy excess capital for innovation [16]. However, this does not rule out the possibility of another cryptocurrency being designed with better scalability in mind. 
        Cryptocurrency’s reliance on pure self-interest to induce honesty can have its own adverse effects on the psychology of individuals in society. It encourages society to be“homines economici”, or those who look out only for their own self- interest without regard for the common good [15]. Conventional currencies are indeed subject to laundering and counterfeit.  There is likely no way to eliminate these risks in their entirety.  However, as bitcoin can be exchanged anonymously, it may amplify illegal financial activity.  
        Cryptocurrency’s unregulated person-to-person global economy has led to concerns that it may become a threat to society. Due to its anonymous nature. It offers criminals a payment mechanism that can facilitate their harmful activities with ease such as child pornography, terrorism, laundering money, narcotics, trafficking, purchase of weapons, drugs and other illegal goods. The example of Silk Road, the first online black market on the deep web is a suitable example. It offered all of these mentioned services and made all of its transaction through bitcoin.
        Inability of used as proper universal currency
        While some countries have explicitly allowed its use and trade, others have banned or restricted it. Likewise, various government agencies, departments, and courts have classified bitcoins differently. In Russia, cryptocurrencies are legal; however, it is illegal to purchase goods with any currency other than the Russian ruble. On March 25, 2014, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) ruled that bitcoin will be treated as property for tax purposes as opposed to currency [17]. With such variable perceptions about the technology, it stagnates its possibility of becoming a universal global currency.
        (Copied entirely from source)Another problem with Bitcoins is its constantly fluctuating according to demand.  This constant fluctuation will cause Bitcoin accepting sites to continuously change its prices. It will also cause a lot of confusion if a refund for a product is to be made. For example, if a t-shirt was returned after it was bought for 1.5 BTC, should 1.5 BTC be returned, even though the valuation has gone up, or should the new amount (calculated according to current valuation) be sent? Which currency should BTC be tied to when comparing valuation? [18]
        Conclusion:
        (Quiet similar to the source) With the use of cryptocurrency inevitable, it is important for society to figure out how to balance a product’s potential for abuse with its benefits. Ethical judgment should be made on the use of the product, not the product itself. Example, painkillers like oxycodone have a serious potential for abuse, but also important medical uses. Thus, bitcoin itself is not evil, although bitcoin, like any other payment system, can be used for evil purposes [15].
